The list in this file does not include daily tasks, but rather changes,
also possibly optional changes, that may take a bit of work and could
modify how the app works for the user.
It can also include bugs that was not practical to fix as soon as they were found.

TODO (code): ThreePointsMenuBar should use a layout manager instead of setMaximumSize / setMinimumSize
TODO (feature): (suggested by github.com/R1ck77) allow user to drag foci around the screen
TODO (optional feature): the app might be extended to use "taxicab distance" and "chessboard distance" (more info at Wikipedia)
