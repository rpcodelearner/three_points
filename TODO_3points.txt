TODO list
    - replace PlaneScreenCoordinates with (two) Ranger, at least in ThreePoints
    - reconsider where createAndSetupWindow() and createAndShowGUI() should belong
    - manage window resizing
    NICE TO HAVE
    - add key controls: ESC -> Exit, +/- -> add/remove a focus and redraw, F5 -> force redraw (makes sense for RND positions)
